### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jona! Welcome to my GitHub !

ðŸ’œ She Codes Aus ðŸ’œ
I completed the She Codes Plus program in April 2023. It's a full-stack coding bootcamp, designed to provide an alternative learning pathway for women to enter the tech industry. 
During the course we had so much fun learning various languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, React, DRF, Restful APIs, JavaScript, and front-end deployment via Fly & Netlify. Most of the work on my Github had been completed during my time with the course. We had completed 6 coding projects in 6 months, during our time at with She Codes Aus.

- TypeScript
- Google Project Management (just completed a course on Agile Methodology)
- Google Cloud Fundementals
- Salesforce Administrator
